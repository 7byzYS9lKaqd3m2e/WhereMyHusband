This is the dream app for any people who find her partner unresponsive, irresponsible, or outright *!@F1*(H@*. Special edition is available for "godness" who need to contact multiple partners simultaneously. 

# Functionality

Manage incoming / outgoing phone calls

# Usage

# Block incoming calls:
Launch the app to foreground. All incoming calls are automatically blocked

# Send outgoing calls:
Type in phone number, then click send. 

# Additional settings:
Maximum duration: you can hang up call after specified duration in seconds
"cut at" starting from when you start call (regardless of whether the call is picked up).
